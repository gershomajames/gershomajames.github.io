Hey there! My name is Gershom and this is where I'll be talking about random stuff that I am thinking about, sort of like a declassified diary of my thoughts!
Here you will find my hopes, frustrations, and ideas all in one place. Not everything I say here is what I completely believe, but more of a place for me to type out my thoughts. I will say confidently that my thoughts and the feelings for that day, unless it's very serious, go away when I wake up. It is with that sort of mindset that I will be writing these little entries. Each day stays in itself. Please don't take things personally because I know a few of you that know me might stumble across this. I love every single one of you guys and I hope that you can get something out of this!
