I guess this is my second post here. It has been a while and every time I want to write about somthing, I am either too busy to have the time to write down my thoughts, or get distracted and forget the thought that I was having. I am hoping to change that about myself.

As for my update, I feel like I am getting on moving towards a better path, and by that I mean both adding and subtracting many aspects of my life. I almost envision it like we are all a number in units, lets say that I am 50 units and you are 65. Our goals that we have are at the end of the day operations that we apply to ourselves to get to that goal. If my goal is 25 but I am very attached to unit 37 in my life. I might keep 37 but get rid of 36 because I realize that I do not need that in my life anymore.

The kicker here is that the goal changes due to circumstance but generally remains around the same ball park depending on the event. I hope that I am making sense here and that you are following with me. I also envision trauma, blessings and other aspects to all add to or subtract from that number. This is the struggle that I am facing at the moment. I would LOVE to know what units are a result of trauma, what are blessings (perhaps in disguise), and what units are just extra baggage that is holding me back.

(I will be back, I have to get somthing done.)
