Today will mark my first post. I am not sure how I am going to write them—if I am just going to stick to the flow of my thoughts, or just draft them and re-order them as I get the thoughts out.

I have been wanting to talk about this for a while, and it's the fact that some people in my life turned out to be more painful than meaningful. You know how when you meet someone for the first time and you get to be emotionally connected to them? Whether that is a friendship or a relationship, that emotional intimacy—the hours, days, and months spent together—all for either them or you to finally call it quits. Afterwards, depending on the situation, they either ghost you due to their coping mechanism to hide away and block people from their life, and that ends up making you feel like you've done something wrong.

As I type this out, I am able to see how it's not healthy, and more toxic than I would like to admit, but I can see that pretty clearly.

Give me a couple hours—it's 3:35 a.m. and I have to attend a meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. I am sleepy, and I think that I can continue this tomorrow. I'll see ya guys in a little bit!

I ended up missing the meeting, but cleaned up today (the 16th), and yeah. I have nothing more to add now and its pretty late (11:47 pm), so I might go to sleep soon.

Love yall! Take care!!
